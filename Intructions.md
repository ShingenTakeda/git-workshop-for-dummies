# Basics

## Getting started

1. **git init -b main** to initialize a folder(repository) and create a branch!(we'll see what a branch is later)
2. **git add .** to add every file! or **git add** ***FILE*** to add specific files
3. add a ***.gitignore*** to ignore files!

## Commiting(Like you don't do in your life) and the time you won't get back

- **git commit -m** to pin that folder in a moment in time with a message
- check your commits with **git log**
- go back in time to check the memories with **git checkout** ***COMMIT***

## Branch out(Because Barbara won't)

- **git branch** ***BRANCH NAME*** to create a branch(kinda like an anternative reality)
- **git checkout** ***BRANCH NAME** to go to that branch
- **git merge** ***BRANCH NAME*** to merge branches, remember to fix conflicts!
